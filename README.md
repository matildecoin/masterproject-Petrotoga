# Masterproject-Petrotoga
In this repository are found the scripts used as part of the comparative genomic analysis of the genus _Petrotoga_.
The analysis was mainly based on preexisting software applications such as stand-alone BLAST, Count, Prokka, and Roary.

The project aims to conduct a comparative genomics analysis of the seven cultivated and sequenced _Petrotoga_ species, along with their closest phylogenetic neighbors, to identify genomic signatures associated with their extreme living environment. 

The analysis is divided in three parts: 
i)

### Specie and Genus determination

### Pagenome analysis

### Evolutionary history
